Uses the Web Audio API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API
to create a musical piano that you can actually play. It comes with the Super Mario Theme built-in.
The keys highlight making it easy to learn a new song.
It has 12 keys (7 white, 5 black) for a single octave but you can change which octave it is while playing.
